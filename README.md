# Surge-FX 

With Surge 1.8 and beyond (since November 2020), the SurgeEffectsBank builds from source in the main surge repo.
This repo is no longer maintained and should not be used.

To build the SurgeEffectsBank, checkout surge and build with -DBUILD_SURGE_JUCE_PLUGINS=TRUE, which will provide the
appropriate cmake target.
